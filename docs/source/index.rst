Welcome to Qualcomm HypX's documentation!
====================================================================


.. warning::

   This is not official documentation. All of this knowledge has been gained through reverse engineering

This is some unofficial documentation for the Qualcomm HypX hypervisor. The goal is to uncover as much of the hypervisor as possible through reverse engineering, emulation, and other techniques.

If you're not familiar with AArch64 architecture and system programming, I recommend checking out :doc:`context/intro`. Otherwise, I would suggest starting at :doc:`general/intro`

Note all the research for this project was done an SM-G9860 with a firmware version of G9860ZCS3HWC1.
